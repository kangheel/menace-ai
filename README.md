Current progress:
- 'board.java'
  - public board(int[] row1, int[] row2, int[] row3)
    - where row1, row2, row3 are int[3]
  - public board()
    - initializes an empty board with values 0
  - public board(board copy)
    - initializes a copy of the board provided
  - public board(String hash)
    - initializes a board with the given hash
  - public board(String hash)
  - public String hash()
  - public boolean is_winner()
  - public int next_turn(int r, int c, int m)
    - updates the board with move at (r,c)
    - returns -1 if unsucessful, 0 if 0's turn next, 1 if 1's turn next 
  - public String boardhashes()
    - returns all the equivalent board hashes (after rotation, reflection, and combination of the two)
- 'game.java'
- 'boardstatemaker.java'
  - creates 'boardstates.txt' file that will be the template for the MENACE boxes
- 'validate_boardstates.java' validates that 'boardstates.txt' has no duplicates including its rotational/reflectional equivalents
  - in order to validate 'boardstates.txt', there must only be hashes in 'boardstates.txt'
